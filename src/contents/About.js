        <p>
          I'm a hardworking and ambitious front-end (React) developer from
          Georgia, who wants to learn as much as possible to enhance my skills
          as an individual and also as a team worker. I always welcome new
          challenges and opportunities, that help me overcome my limits. I
          think, that developing web designs is a new generation of arts and
          every developer should strive to create products they will be proud of
          later.
